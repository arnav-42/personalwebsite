Site: arnav.id

This is my personal website. I use Cloudflare pages for hosting.

Previous versions of this site (before current refactor) included all sorts of overhead. As my taste in webpages has changed and my appreciation for simplicity has grown, I've changed my website to be as simple as possible. You might still see some JS animation code left over in the repo - that's something I'll clean up eventually.

I might yet again refactor the website entirely one day - I didn't know about stuff like Jekyll before I started.
