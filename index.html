            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm an engineering student at Purdue. I'm currently interning at Wealthstone Group focusing on alternative assets. My interests lie in how machine learning, optimization, and algorithmic strategies can be applied to solve real-world problems. In my free time, I like to play guitar, read, and write. Here's a list of things I've worked on in the past or am currently working on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An MCP-enabled AI tool (think what Cortana should have been)</li>
                <li>A Streamlit dashboard template for analyzing investment portfolios with all proprietary information hidden server-side</li>
                <li>An implementation of common guitar effects with Rust</li>
                <li>An open-soure CLI tool to create boilerplate for Project Euler solutions</li>
                <li>An algorithm to generate trading signals from newly-released SEC filings in real time</li>
                <li>An automation tool for filling in slide decks with Excel data (was surprised this wasn't a thing already??)</li>
                <li>A system to detect cross-exchange and triangular arbitrage opportunities for cryptocurrencies (led the project as a part of Purdue's quant finance club)</li>
                <li>An electric guitar multi-FX pedal with the ESP8266 microcontroller</li>
                <li>A collection of trading strategies centered around the Markov property</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you would like to collaborate on anything or have any questions, please feel free to reach out using the contact info on the left.</p>
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I primarily work in Python and Julia, but I know C, Verilog/SystemVerilog, MATLAB, and Java as well. I know enough Flask, JS, and HTML/CSS to throw together a quick webapp. On the software side, I can use Bloomberg Terminal, AutoCAD, LTSpice, and Blender. I am currently learning, in no particular order: Rust, Django, React, AWS, and the ukulele.</p>
